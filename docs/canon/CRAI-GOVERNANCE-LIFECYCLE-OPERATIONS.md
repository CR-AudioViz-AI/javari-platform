# SECTION 8
## ProductionReadinessOS™

**Originally Section 95 in CRAI Master Bible**

**Phased Execution Framework & Launch Governance Operating System**

---

## 95.0 Purpose & Strategic Role

**ProductionReadinessOS™** is the canonical operating system governing how the CRAudioVizAI / Javari ecosystem transitions from development to production through controlled, revenue-safe, phased execution.

ProductionReadinessOS ensures:

- No launch happens without readiness validation
- Revenue systems are protected during rollout
- Each phase has explicit gates and success criteria  
- Risk is managed through incremental exposure
- Canon is locked before execution begins

**ProductionReadinessOS is a Tier-0 Mandatory Launch Governance Layer.**

If readiness is not proven, launch does not proceed.

---

## 95.1 Canon Lock Doctrine

Before any production deployment:

1. **Bible Must Be Locked:** No architectural changes during execution
2. **Scope Must Be Frozen:** Phase scope cannot expand mid-flight
3. **Flags Must Be Defined:** All feature flags deployed and tested
4. **Rollback Must Be Proven:** Every deployment has a tested rollback path
5. **Evidence Must Exist:** Audit trails ready for regulatory review

**Canon lock prevents execution chaos.**

---
