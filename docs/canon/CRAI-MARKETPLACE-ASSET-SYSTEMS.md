# SECTION 7
## ProvenanceOS™ — Universal Chain-of-Custody, Authenticity & Trust Infrastructure

**Originally Section 52 in CRAI Master Bible**

---

## 52.0 Purpose & Strategic Role

ProvenanceOS™ is the canonical trust, authenticity, and chain-of-custody operating system for all assets, records, identities, and transactions within the CRAudioVizAI / Javari ecosystem.

ProvenanceOS answers, with legal and technical rigor:

- What is this asset?  
- Where did it come from?  
- Who owned it, and when?  
- Was it altered, forged, disputed, or compromised?  
- Can its history withstand audit, court, insurance, or regulatory scrutiny?  

ProvenanceOS is a **Tier-0 Trust Engine**.  
**Without ProvenanceOS, no value claim is final.**
