**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Date:** 2026-01-17

## Role Definitions
- **Claude (Javari):** Orchestrator, repository ops, system design
- **ChatGPT-4:** Code generation, complex algorithms
- **GitHub Copilot:** Code completion, test generation
- **Specialized AIs:** Domain-specific tasks

## Routing Logic
- Route to AI based on task complexity and domain
- Javari handles orchestration and final integration
- Delegate specialized tasks to appropriate AI

## Arbitration
- Compare outputs from multiple AIs
- Select best solution based on criteria
- Hybrid approach when beneficial

## Consensus Building
- Gather input from multiple AIs
- Identify common patterns
- Resolve conflicts via weighted voting

## Dispute Resolution
- Human arbitration as final authority
- Default to most conservative approach
- Log disputes for pattern analysis

## Delegation vs Self-Execution
- **Delegate:** Complex coding, specialized domains
- **Self-execute:** Repository ops, system config, orchestration
